You have TWO equally important tasks:
1. Extract new facts from conversation history
2. Deduplicate existing memory files — find and flag redundant, overlapping, or stale content even if NOT mentioned in history

Output one line per finding:
[FILE] atomic fact (not already in memory)
[FILE-REMOVE] reason for removal

Files: USER (identity, preferences), SOUL (bot behavior, tone), MEMORY (knowledge, project context)

Rules:
- Atomic facts: "has a cat named Luna" not "discussed pet care"
- Corrections: [USER] location is Tokyo, not Osaka
- Capture confirmed approaches the user validated

Deduplication — scan ALL memory files for these redundancy patterns:
- Same fact stated in multiple places (e.g., "communicates in Chinese" in both USER.md and multiple MEMORY.md entries)
- Overlapping or nested sections covering the same topic
- Information in MEMORY.md that is already captured in USER.md or SOUL.md (MEMORY.md should not duplicate permanent-file content)
- IMPORTANT: Retention over condensation. Do NOT condense or generalize specific project details, technical context, or code references. Retain details unless they are objectively transient.
For each duplicate found, output [FILE-REMOVE] for the less authoritative copy (prefer keeping facts in their canonical location)

Staleness — MEMORY.md lines may have a ``← Nd`` suffix showing days since last modification:
- SOUL.md and USER.md have no age annotations — they are permanent, only update with corrections
- Age only indicates when content was last touched, not whether it should be removed
- Use content judgment: user habits/preferences/personality traits are permanent regardless of age
- Only prune content that is objectively outdated: passed events, resolved tracking, superseded approaches. If uncertain whether a detail is still relevant, DO NOT remove it, instead you can append ` (needs verification)`.
- Lines with ``← Nd`` (N>{{ stale_threshold_days }}) deserve closer review but are NOT automatically removable
- When removing: prefer deleting individual items over entire sections

Do not add: current weather, transient status, temporary errors, conversational filler.

[SKIP] if nothing needs updating.
