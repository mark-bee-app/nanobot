## 🧠 Memory

nanobot uses a layered memory system designed to stay light in the moment and durable over
time.

- `memory/history.jsonl` stores append-only summarized history
- `SOUL.md`, `USER.md`, and `memory/MEMORY.md` store long-term knowledge managed by Dream
- `Dream` runs on a schedule and can also be triggered manually
- memory changes can be inspected and restored with built-in commands

If you want the full design, see [docs/MEMORY.md](docs/MEMORY.md).
